💻 Laptop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Laptop Price Predictor – a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that estimates the price of a laptop based on user-specified features such as RAM, screen size, CPU type, GPU brand, storage, and more.

🔍 Project Overview
Many users find it hard to estimate the price of a laptop based on specifications alone. This project uses machine learning regression techniques to predict laptop prices accurately based on various hardware and brand features.

Key stages of this project include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature engineering and encoding
Model training with advanced regression algorithms
Deployment using Streamlit
🚀 Demo
Launch the app locally using:

streamlit run app.py
Note: Ensure model.pkl and laptop_price.csv are in the same directory as app.py.
